# Insurance-System

This system is one that an insurance company will use to manage their clients and policies. The system will be used by the insurance company’s staff to:

Add new clients,

Delete existing clients,

Add new policies for existing clients,

Calculate the cost of premiums for any given policy,

Calculate the total cost of premiums for all policies for a client,

Applying discounts for clients who have multiple policies.

Due to the insurance company’s limited budget (it’s apparently tough being an insurance company), we will only design for them a terminal-driven interface. This means that the system will be controlled by a menu system that will be displayed on the terminal. The menu will allow the staff member to select from a list of commands. The staff member will be able to select a command by typing its code, and any arguments it expects. Some commands require additional options, which are prompted by the system one at a time. The system will then execute the appropriate action.
